Space Invaders Game (SystemVerilog - FPGA)

This repository contains the implementation of a Space Invaders game developed in SystemVerilog and designed to run on an FPGA platform. The project replicates the classic arcade game, featuring alien invaders, a player-controlled spaceship, bullets, and collisions.

Features

	•	Player-controlled spaceship movement and shooting mechanics.
	•	Alien invaders that move and descend dynamically.
	•	Collision detection for bullets and invaders.
	•	Health bar for tracking the player’s spaceship health.
	•	Randomized alien bullet trajectories for increased difficulty.
	•	Integration with a 16x16 bitmap matrix for alien positioning.
	•	Real-time gameplay rendered on FPGA-connected display.

Goals

This project demonstrates:
	1.	Proficiency in SystemVerilog for hardware description.
	2.	Implementation of real-time graphics and interaction logic.
	3.	FPGA programming for handling game logic and rendering.

Requirements

To run this project, you will need:
	•	An FPGA board with sufficient resources (e.g., Xilinx or Intel FPGA).
	•	A compatible FPGA development environment (Vivado, Quartus, etc.).
	•	Display hardware connected to the FPGA for game output.
	•	Basic knowledge of SystemVerilog and FPGA workflow.
